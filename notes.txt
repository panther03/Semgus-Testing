- sudoku z3 solution
- why don't the SMT files work
- probably will have to put off CHCs for now
- try SyGUS problems | any actual examples? | keep working
- learn CHCs | any resources lol	
- theoretical concepts (first order logic)
- Z3 datatypes (lists and arrays and custom datatypes) (Check EUSolver Z3 output) (quantifier) | how to fucgkin build eusolver? ?? free working 2020 descargar para android?? | keep working on this
- more complex Z3 aspects

- take a semgus problem from the paper and write in rosette


- Translate the semantics given by CHCs to the mechanism of defining semantics that can be defined in the language Rosette or Sketch
- Rosette lets you define semantics for your own operates
- Read up on introductory program semantics
- CHCs are just a way of equipping a program with semantics
